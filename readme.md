# Cybersecurity Challenge for Applicants

## Challenge
The challenge is meant to assess your skills in solving Cybersecurity tasks.
To begin the challenge, simply execute the binary and follow the hints.

## Goal
The goal of the challenge is to find the flag, i.e. a string containing a code-word. You will recognize the flag once you see it.


## Task
The goal is to solve the challenge without dissection the binary itself. I.e. please do not decompile or use string-grap to find the flag.
Document your steps that you used to find the flag. Once you finished the challenge, please submit the report to us.

Happy Hacking :-)
